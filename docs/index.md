# HomeAutomation Documentation

## Motivation

This project was started to learn things about various IoT and home automation related technologies.

Another important aspect was that all essential functions should be available without reliance on a third party service (e.g. the cloud).

Technologies that are selected should be secure and easy to interface with.

The system uses OpenUI5 for the frontend part.

For certain parts other home automation software is being used as a service.
This is especially true for FHEM and HAP-Java.

The system consists of two main components.
A server to provide the UI, data storage and control infrastructure and a client to interface with distributed aspects of the system (e.g. sensor readings).
